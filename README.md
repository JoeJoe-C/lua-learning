# Learning Lua

This repository is dedicated to learning lua, in order to be able to be comfortable with the lua language I will complete the following projects:

- [] Create a TODO list application
- [] Create Data structures from scratch written in lua
- [] Create an app with API capabilities
- [] Create an Neovim plugin
- [] Create an app that uses coroutines
- [] Create a parser
- [] Create a game

Each folder will have it's own README where it highlights the features, lessons learnt. What went wrong and what went right for the sake of reflection and learning.

Thanks for reading! :)
